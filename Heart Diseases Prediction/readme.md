# Heart Disease Prediction

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using various machine learning models and deep learning models.

## Project Overview

In this project, we perform the following tasks:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Load and preprocess the heart disease dataset.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. Machine Learning Models:
   - Implement logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting, ensemble, adaboost, and xgboost models for heart disease prediction.
   - Optimize hyperparameters using grid search.

3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model:
   - Create and train a deep learning CNN model for heart disease prediction.
   - Visualize model accuracy and loss over epochs.

4. Deep Neural Network (DNN) Model:
   - Implement a deep neural network model for heart disease prediction.
   - Visualize model accuracy and loss over epochs.

5. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
   - Save the best-performing models for future use.
