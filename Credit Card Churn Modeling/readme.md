# Credit Card Churn Prediction

This folder contains code and notebooks for a predictive analysis project on credit card churn. The project focuses on predicting customer churn in the credit card industry.

## Project Overview

In this project, I perform the following tasks:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. Machine Learning Models:
   - Implement logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting, voting, and adaboost models for churn prediction.
   - Optimize hyperparameters using grid search and Bayesian optimization.

3. Deep Learning Models:
   - Create and train DNN, CNN models for churn prediction.
   - Optimize hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

5. Visualization:
   - Visualize model accuracy and loss over epochs.
