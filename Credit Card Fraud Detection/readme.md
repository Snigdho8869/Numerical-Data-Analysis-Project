# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project is focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using various machine learning models and a neural network.

## Project Overview

In this project, I perform the following tasks:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. Machine Learning Models:
   - Implement logistic regression, random forest, extra tree classifier, voting, adaboost, and xgboost models for fraud detection.

3. Deep Learning Model:
   - Create and train a deep neural network for fraud detection.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate model performance using classification reports, accuracy, and loss metrics.

5. Visualization:
   - Visualize model accuracy and loss over epochs.
